This repository contains essential code snippets from my ongoing First-Person Shooter (FPS) Game Project, offering a glimpse into the development process and the innovative techniques employed. Accompanied by a detailed PDF document and an explanatory video, these resources collectively provide an overview of the game's architecture, design patterns, and functionality enhancements. Ideal for enthusiasts and fellow developers interested in the intricacies of game development with Unreal Engine 5 and C++, this content not only showcases technical skills but also serves as a learning tool for those keen on understanding modern game development practices.
